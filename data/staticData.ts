      "In 2006, with our combined experience as a broker and contractor, we established Kenwood Builders. That year, we built two homes, putting our heart into every detail as if we were building for ourselves. By 2010, we had taken on our biggest project yet—a 12,000-square-foot estate in Newton, complete with a movie theater and gym. This project not only marked a significant milestone but also showcased our capability and vision for the future. Our journey was just beginning, and we were driven by the desire to create something exceptional",

Over the next few years, we focused on refining our craft, taking on more projects, and ensuring that each home reflected our dedication to quality and detail. By 2014, our portfolio had expanded significantly, and our reputation for exceeding expectations was firmly established in the market. We continued to grow, always striving to push the boundaries of what we could achieve, driven by our passion for creating beautiful, well-crafted homes that stand the test of time.",

      "With a strong foundation, we decided it was time to broaden our scope. Our travels had exposed us to new design trends and construction methods, which we were eager to bring back to Boston. In 2017, we entered the commercial development sector, working on high-end and mixed-use buildings. This new challenge allowed us to apply our commitment to quality on a larger scale, not only shaping homes but also contributing to Boston's skyline. We prepared for these new ventures by refining our focus on innovation and sustainability, setting the stage for the launch of our future companies.",

In 2023, we founded Architectural Trends, a company dedicated to bringing the latest European design trends to Boston. These ventures reflect our ongoing commitment to innovation and our desire to continuously offer the best to our clients. Today, we continue to drive innovation in Boston’s architectural landscape, staying at the forefront of design and construction trends, ensuring every project reflects our commitment to excellence.",
